{"title": "10+ Free CDN Services to Speed Up WordPress", "content": "<p>In today\u2019s world where the average Internet speed of technologically advanced regions exceeds 10 Mbps, it\u2019s no wonder that CDN services thrive. And to speed things up even more, some lucky readers can enjoy speeds up to 1 Gbps \u2013 yes one gigabits per second, thanks to services such as\u00a0<a title=\"Google Fiber\" href=\"https://fiber.google.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Fiber</a>, Cox Gigablast or Centurylink Gigabit. As a downside to this race for faster bits, our attention span takes a toll and patience, becomes volatile.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s always good to have your site powered by a Content Delivery Network. Not only does a CDN save bandwidth costs from your hosting provider, but your site becomes insanely fast and tends to rank higher in the search engines.\u00a0You might have heard this saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some people say that nothing in this world is free,<br />\nI say you just need to know where to look!</p></blockquote>\n<h2>What is a CDN \u2013 Content Delivery Network?</h2>\n<p>Before we dig into free CDNs for your WordPress website, let\u2019s cover the basics. Put simply, a Content Delivery Network or a CDN is a bunch of servers, located across the globe, designed to deliver your website\u2019s files to the site\u2019s visitor in the fastest time. Three points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bunch of servers.</li>\n<li>Located across the globe.</li>\n<li>Delivers your website\u2019s static files (images, PDFs, static libraries such as JavaScript and CSS files) in the fastest time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why A CDN?</p>\n<p>A new website usually has one source of origin. And that\u2019s okay when you\u2019re starting out and don\u2019t have a lot of visitors. As your website grows, (i.e. your traffic increases) the amount of time taken to load your site would also increase.</p>\n<p>People generally don\u2019t like\u00a0<em>waiting\u00a0</em>for a website. The effect is most powerful in online shopping websites, where a one-second drop in loading time added to $6,000,000 USD (that\u2019s 6 million) in revenue. I picked this up from CachePoint\u2019s brilliant article \u2013\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.catchpoint.com/2017/01/06/performance-impact-revenue-real/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Very Real Performance Impact on Revenue</em></a>.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we have a CDN. It speeds up content delivery by serving the content from the server that is closest to the visitor. Your loading time decreases and you end up winning. If you want to understand CDNs better,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.incapsula.com/cdn-guide/?src=176\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Incapsula\u2019s CDN guide</a>\u00a0is a great place to start.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started with the CDN List</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ll structure this article into four groups<b>:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Group<strong>\u00a0one</strong>\u00a0are the absolutely free CDN services that will have a\u00a0<strong>forever-free plan.</strong></li>\n<li>CDNs under group<strong>\u00a0two</strong>\u00a0are ones offer\u00a0<strong>generous trial periods</strong>\u00a0(think twelve months) \u2013 that are sufficient to scale up your blog.</li>\n<li>Group\u00a0<strong>three</strong>\u00a0contains CDNs that are again absolutely\u00a0<strong>free for hosting common scripts</strong>such as jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.</li>\n<li>Group\u00a0<strong>four</strong>\u00a0is contains\u00a0<strong>honorable mentions</strong>\u00a0that are no longer active, but were alive at the time this article was originally posted (that\u2019s way back in 2016).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Free CDNs for WordPress that have a Forever-Free Plan</h2>\n<p>Given that you\u2019ve landed on this page for \u201cfree CDN for WordPress\u201d, let\u2019s dive down into the article.</p>\n<h3>1.

Swarmify</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-121\" src=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smarmify-cdn.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"379\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smarmify-cdn.png 800w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smarmify-cdn-300x142.png 300w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smarmify-cdn-768x364.png 768w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smarmify-cdn-200x95.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p>Swarmify, (previously known as SwarmCDN) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) based content delivery network that offers 10GB bandwidth (only for images) in their free plan. To try it out, download the\u00a0<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/swarm-cdn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress plugin</a>\u00a0and give it a go. It is interesting to note that Swarmify works in a slightly different manner:</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say a group of people are browsing your site. Think of them as the first \u2018peer\u2019 in P2P.\u00a0When a new visitor (peer) arrives, the images are served from the already existing group of users (the previous peer). This saves your server\u2019s bandwidth, and improves loading times, since the peers are usually closer to one another. Swarmify also offers video CDN, which is only a part of their paid plan.</p>\n<h2>Trial CDN Services that are as Good as Free:</h2>\n<p>In this section, we\u2019ll explore some of the premium cloud CDN providers that offer a generous trial period. I would think that the trial duration would be sufficient to test the service and eventually upgrade to a paid plan</p>\n<p>To give you some context, the future of the web is in the cloud. Be it the content delivery for your WordPress site, or high performance computing for NASA \u2013 the cloud is everywhere.

Once you obtain a free trial, fine-tuning it requires a sound know-how, which can be gained from\u00a0<a title=\"How To Do An Effective CDN Trial\" href=\"http://www.cdnplanet.com/blog/how-do-effective-trial-cdn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this awesome article.</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a title=\"MetaCDN\" href=\"http://www.metacdn.com/signup-trial.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MetaCDN\u00a0</a>\u2013 Offering a 7 day trial period with unrestricted access to all services and no credit card signup required \u2013 MetaCDN is a good choice for a trial CDN.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cdn77.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CDN77</a>\u00a0\u2013 They\u00a0offer a 14-day trial with access to all the features available in the premium plan and without having to provide a credit card. If you decide to continue using their service you will be charged only for what you use per byte (pro-rated).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.keycdn.com/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KeyCDN</a>\u00a0\u2013 They offer a free trial period without having to provide a credit card when signing up it appears they provide you with 250GB of free transfer during the trial period.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>To keep it short, I would like to remind you that all good things must come to an end. There have been instances of free CDN companies which have stopped offering their service for free (Exabytes) or have shut down completely (SpeedyMirror, CoBlitz) \u2013 which brings us to an important conclusion:</p>\n<h3>When should I switch to A proper CDN?</h3>\n<p>A free CDN service will last only for so long. Once your traffic begins to increase \u2013 you\u2019ll eventually run out of trial bandwidth and/or your visitors might start grumbling about a slow website. That\u2019s your green light switch over to a proper CDN service such as\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.cdn77.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDN77</a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a title=\"Amazon CloudFront\" href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon CloudFront</a>.\u00a0Happy trails, Roadrunner!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>source</p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2L4sKYqSrs\"><p><a href=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/free-cdn-services-for-wordpress/\">10+ Free CDN Services to Speed Up WordPress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"\u201c10+ Free CDN Services to Speed Up WordPress\u201d &#8212; WPExplorer\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://www.wpexplorer.com/free-cdn-services-for-wordpress/embed/#?secret=2L4sKYqSrs\" data-secret=\"2L4sKYqSrs\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n", "slug": "10-free-cdn-services-to-speed-up-wordpress", "date": 1519026653, "cats": [0, 11]}
