A few more days and we were live on our new infrastructure composed of\u2026 1 server; running your typical Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL stack, with a hint of Memcached.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this infrastructure quickly became obsolete.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Not only didn\u2019t it scale at all but, more importantly, every part of it was a Single Point Of Failure.

You need to plan your needs well in advance: buy a machine\u2014\u200busually leased for a minimum of 1 month\u2014\u200bwait for it to be ready\u2014\u200bwhich can take from 2 minutes to 3 days-, install its base os, install Ansible\u2019s dependencies (mainly python and a few other packages) then, finally, run your Ansible scripts against it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For us this entire process was wholly unpractical and what usually happened is that we\u2019d add capacity for an anticipated peak load, but never would remove it afterwards which in turn added to our costs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>It is worth noting, however, that even though having unused capacity in your infrastructure is akin to setting cash on fire, it is still a magnitude less expensive on bare-metal than in the cloud. On the other hand, the engineering headaches that come with using bare-metal servers simply shift the cost from purely material to administrative ones.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In our bare-metal setup capacity planning, server administration and Ansible scripting were just the tip of the iceberb.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect2\">\n<h3 id=\"_scaling_development_processes\">Scaling development processes</h3>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In early 2017, while our infrastructure had grown, so had our team.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We hired 7 more engineers making us a small 9 people team, with skillsets distributed all over the spectrum from backend to frontend with varying levels of seniority.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Even in a small 9 people team, being productive and limiting the amount of bugs deployed to production warrants a simple, easy to setup and easy to use development-staging-production trifecta.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Setting up your development environment as a new hire shouldn\u2019t take hours, neither should upgrading or re-creating it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Moreover, a company-wide accessible staging environment should exist and match 99% of your production, if not 100%.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Unfortunately, in our hardware infrastructure reaching this harmonious trifecta was impossible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"_the_development_environment\">The development environment</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>First of all, everybody in our engineering team uses MacBook Pros, which is an issue since our stack is linux based.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>However, asking everybody to switch to linux and potentially change their precious workflow wasn\u2019t really ideal. This meant that the best solution was to provide a development environment agnostic of developers\u2019 personal preferences in machines.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I could only see two obvious options:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Either provide a Vagrant stack that would run multiple virtual machines (17 potentially, though, more realistically, 1 machine running our entire stack), or, re-use the already written ansible scripts and run them against our local macbooks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After investigating Vagrant, I felt that using virtual machines would hinder performances too much and wasn\u2019t worth it. I decided, for better or worse, to go the Ansible route (in hindsight, this probably wasn\u2019t the best decision).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>We would use the same set of Ansible scripts on production, staging and dev. The caveat being of course that our development stack, although close to production, was not a 100% match.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This worked well enough for a while; However, the mismatch caused issues later when, for example, our development and production MySQL versions weren\u2019t aligned. Some queries that ran on dev, wouldn\u2019t on production.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect3\">\n<h4 id=\"_the_staging_environment\">The staging environment</h4>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Secondly, having a development and production environments running on widely different softwares (mac os versus debian) meant that we absolutely needed a staging environment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Not only because of potential bugs caused by version mismatches, but also because we needed a way to share new features to external members before launch.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Once again I had multiple choices:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>buy 17 servers and run ansible against them. This would double our costs though and we were trying to save money.</li>\n<li>setup our entire stack on a unique linux server, accessible from the outside. Cheaper solution, but once again not providing an exact replica of our production system.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I decided to implement the cost-saving solution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>An early version of the staging environment involved 3 independant linux servers, each running the entire stack. Developers would then yell across the room (or hipchat) \u201ctaking over dev1\u201d, \u201cis anybody using dev3?\u201d, \u201cdev2 is down\u00a0:/\u201d.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Overall, our development-staging-production setup was far from optimal: it did the job; but definitely needed improvements.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_the_advent_ofdocker\">The advent of\u00a0Docker</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In 2013 Dotcloud released Docker.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The Betabrand use case for Docker was immediately obvious. I saw it as the solution to simplify our development and staging environments; by getting rid of the ansible scripts (well, almost; more on that later).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Those scripts would now only be used for production.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the time, one main pain point for the team was competing for our three physical staging servers: dev1, dev2 and dev3; and for me maintaining those 3 servers was a major annoyance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After observing docker for a few months, I decided to give it a go in April 2014.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After installing docker on one of the staging servers, I created a single docker image containing our entire stack (haproxy, varnish, redis, apache, etc.) then over the next few months wrote a tool (<code>sailor</code>) allowing us to create, destroy and manage an infinite number of staging environment accessible via individual unique URLs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<div class=\"title\"></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Worth noting that docker-compose didn\u2019t exist at that time; and that putting your entire stack inside one docker image is of course a big no-no but that\u2019s an unimportant detail here.</p>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>From this point on, the team wasn\u2019t competing anymore for access to the staging servers. Anybody could create a new, fully configured, staging container from the docker image using sailor. I didn\u2019t need to maintain the servers anymore either; better yet, I shut down and cancelled 2 of them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Our development environment, however, still was running on macos (well, \u201cMac OS X\u201d at the time) and using the Ansible scripts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Then, sometime around 2016 docker-machine was released.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Docker machine is a tool taking care of deploying a docker daemon on any stack of your choice: virtualbox, aws, gce, bare-metal, azure, you name it, docker-machine does it; in one command line.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I saw it as the opportunity to easily and quickly migrate our ansible-based development environment to a docker based one. I modified\u00a0<code>sailor</code>\u00a0to use docker-machine as its backend.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Setting up a development environment was now a matter of creating a new docker-machine then passing a flag for sailor to use it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At this point, our development-staging process had been simplified tremendously; at least from a dev-ops perspective: anytime I needed to upgrade any software of our stack to a newer version or change the configuration, instead of modifying my ansible scripts, asking all the team to run them, then running them myself on all 3 staging servers; I could now simply push a new docker image.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Ironically enough, I ended up needing virtual machines (which I had deliberately avoided) to run docker on our macbooks. Using vagrant instead of Ansible would have been a better choice from the get go. Hindsight is always 20/20.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Using docker for our development and staging systems paved the way to the better solution that Betabrand.com now runs on.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_kubernetes\">Kubernetes</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Because Betabrand is primarily an e-commerce platform, Black Friday loomed over our website more and more each year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>To our surprise, the website had handled increasingly higher loads since 2013 without failing in any major catastrophe, but, it did require a month long preparation beforehand: adding capacity, load testing and optimizing our checkout code paths as much as we possibly could.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>After preparing for Black Friday 2016, however, it became evident the infrastructure wouldn\u2019t scale for Black Friday 2017; I worried the website would become inacessible under the load.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Luckily, sometime in 2015, the release of Kubernetes 1.0 caught my attention.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Just like I saw in docker an obvious use-case, I knew k8s was what we needed to solve many of our issues. First of all, it would finally allow us to run an\u00a0<em>almost</em>\u00a0identical dev-staging-production environment. But also, would solve our scalability issues.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>I also evaluated 2 other solutions, Nomad and Docker Swarm, but Kubernetes seemed to be the most promising.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For Black Friday 2017, I set out to migrate our entire infra to k8s.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonitionblock note\">\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"icon\">\n<div class=\"title\"></div>\n</td>\n<td class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Although I considered it, I quickly ruled out using our current OVH bare-metal servers for our k8s nodes since it would play against my goal of getting rid of Ansible and not dealing with all the issue that comes with hardware servers.
