{"title": "Full CI/CD pipeline to deploy multi-containers application on Azure Container Service with Docker Swarm using Visual Studio Team Services", "content": "<div id=\"at_zurlpreview\">\n<p class=\"imgd\">Azure Container Service (ACS) allows to deploy and manage containers using Docker Swarm, Mesosphere DC/OS or Kubernetes orchestrators. Recently, the ACS team open sources ACS-engine. It is now very easy to deploy these three orchestrators on Azure, using the portal, an Azure Resource Manager template or Azure-CLI. They also have released in preview the Azure Container Registry which is an implementation of the open source Docker Registry and that can run as a service on Azure and is fully compatible with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and DC/OS. This is a private registry that allows to store Docker images for enterprise applications instead of having to use the public Docker Hub, for example. In this new blog post I will detail how I have used ACS with Docker Swarm, an Azure Container Registry and Visual Studio Team Services to deliver continuously a multi-containers application wrote in .NET Core. Tooling has also been recently released to create a similar CI/CD pipeline with VSTS when using Mesosphere DC/OS.</p>\n<p class=\"imgs\">Source: <a href=\"https://blog.jcorioland.io/archives/2016/11/29/full-ci-cd-pipeline-to-deploy-multi-containers-application-on-azure-container-service-docker-swarm-using-visual-studio-team-services.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blog.jcorioland.io/archives/2016/11/29/full-ci-cd-pipeline-to-deploy-multi-containers-application-on-azure-container-service-docker-swarm-using-visual-studio-team-services.html</a></p>\n</div>\n", "slug": "full-ci-cd-pipeline-to-deploy-multi-containers-application-on-azure-container-service-with-docker-swarm-using-visual-studio-team-services", "date": 1549552547, "cats": [0, 8, 1, 9]}
