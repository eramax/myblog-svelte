{"title": "The Best JS Frameworks for Front End", "content": "<div id=\"at_zurlpreview\">\n<p>You might know this game already: you say a word and google a JavaScript framework with that name. If there\u2019s no relevant framework, you lose and drink a shot.</p>\n<p>As practice shows, you can easily win this game because there are so many JavaScript app frameworks. For frontend developers, it\u2019s increasingly challenging to make up their minds about which JavaScript application framework to choose, especially when they need to build a single-page application.</p>\n<figure><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-519\" title=\"Popular JS Frameworks and Libraries\" src=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/js-frameworks.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/js-frameworks.jpg 700w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/js-frameworks-300x111.jpg 300w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/js-frameworks-604x223.jpg 604w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption>Popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Since developers are often the ones deciding which JS framework will do the job, they face a tough challenge because\u00a0<em>they have to choose</em>.</p>\n<p>To simplify this choice of a JS framework for client-side development, we should reduce our options to several top solutions. For client-side development, our list of JavaScript frameworks includes React, Angular (Angular 2 or higher), Vue, Backbone, and Ember.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at JavaScript frameworks comparison in the following table:</p>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Name</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Type</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Shadow DOM<br />\nEcmasScript 6+</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Relative<br />\nPopularity</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Difficulty of<br />\nLearning</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>React</td>\n<td>Library</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>*****</td>\n<td>*****</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Angular</td>\n<td>Framework</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>***</td>\n<td>*****</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ember</td>\n<td>Framework</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>*</td>\n<td>*****</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Vue</td>\n<td>Library</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>**</td>\n<td>***</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Backbone</td>\n<td>Framework</td>\n<td>Supported</td>\n<td>*</td>\n<td>***</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Not every JavaScript-based \u201cframework\u201d we\u2019ve just mentioned is an actual framework. But we can throw in several libraries to the pack and make those not-quite-frameworks feel like actual ones. We\u2019re talking about React and Vue, which are both JS libraries for the view layer; and Backbone, which also only partially implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. For the purposes of this overview, however, we\u2019ll use the term \u201cframework\u201d loosely to refer to all five of these JavaScript solutions.</p>\n<h2>The Best JS Frameworks for Front End</h2>\n<h3 style=\"display: none;\">The Best JS Frameworks for Front End</h3>\n<p class=\"imgp\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-520\" src=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs.png 1280w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs-300x74.png 300w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs-768x190.png 768w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs-1024x253.png 1024w, https://emolike.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Top-JS-Frameworks-for-Building-SPAs-604x149.png 604w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></p>\n<p class=\"imgd\">Choosing a JavaScript framework for frontend web development is very difficult given how many JavaScript frameworks exist.
